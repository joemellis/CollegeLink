User Stories
- As a user, I can easily navigate to the login or sign-up page upon entering the site, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.
- As a logged-in user, I can access my profile page where I can add a profile picture and update my bio, allowing me to personalize my profile and share information with others.
- As a user, I can filter the database by selecting one of three buttons: workshops, events, or study groups, enabling me to quickly find the type of content I'm interested in.
- As a logged-in user, I can create a new workshop, event, or study group, specifying relevant details such as date, time, location, and description, empowering me to organize and promote activities within the community.
- As a user  I want detailed information about each interdimensional destination, including any potential risks or challenges, to ensure a secure and enjoyable trip.
- As a user, I can edit and delete my own posts (workshops, events, or study groups) to make necessary updates or remove outdated information.
